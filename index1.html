<!--![Hangman](Images/2-Hangman.jpg)

1. [Watch the demo](hangman-game-demo.mov).

2. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

4. Display the following on the page:

5. Press any key to get started!

6. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

7. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

8. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

9. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

##### Hangman Game Bonuses

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
3. **HARD MODE:** Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
4. Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
5. Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
6. Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
   * Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
7. Definitely talk with a TA or your instructor if you get tripped up during this challenge.-->


pseudo code for hangman game: 1. pick a word & print empty spaces to screen 2. check user input Details: - onkeyup -> everything
happens based on me! a. check and store as lowercase/uppercase (for matching) b. check if valid (letter, etc.?) c. check
to see if part of word i. if indexOf x in arr === -1 true = incorrect guess else = correct guess Correct: arr of correct
guesses pust to array reveal in puzzle *function* var = "" loop length of word check character at incrementer of word== indexOf
character (in correct) if true = var = var+x else = var = var+"_" check for victory (compare var letters in word w/ arr of
correct guesses) Incorrect: arr of incorrect guesses push to array decrease guesses left display array of incorrect guesses
var str = arrOfIncorrect.join(', ') check for loss (incremement losses) if loss alert Game Over and restart Restart: remove
word form words arr choose new word --> reset display reset: guesses remaining-->update display user guesses-->update display
correct letters-->update display incorrect letters update win display & loss display remake winningLetters arr based on new
word d. if yes --> check guessed letters and if in guessed letters do nothing, else add to list of guessed letters* if no
--> do nothing e. How? make an array of letters - if index of letter in array is not -1 (!==-1) 3. see if it's part of the
word* Details: a. google js delete array duplicates b. "all" ['a', 'l', 'l'] preferably ['a', 'l'] (e.g., arr.filter) c.
var uniquearr=arr.filter (function (item, pos, self)) ("a" 0 uniquearr) return (self.indexOf(item)=== -1) d. word.split("")
or word.split(" ") opposite of arr.join 4. give feedback for win 5. check for win

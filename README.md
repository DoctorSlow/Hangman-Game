# Hangman-Game

This is a basic variation on the classic hangman type game. A random word is chosen for the player and represented by underscores on the screen. You must guess the letters or 'die' trying. Each correct guess will reveal the letter(s) in the puzzle, while each incorrect guess will land you one step closer to the edge as your incorrect guesses are limited. Good luck.
